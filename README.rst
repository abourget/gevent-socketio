``gevent-socketio`` is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO
protocol, developed originally for Node.js by LearnBoost and then
ported to other languages.  Socket.IO enables real-time web
communications between a browser and a server, using a WebSocket-like
API.  One aim of this project is to provide a single ``gevent``-based
API that works across the different WSGI-based web frameworks out
there (Pyramid, Pylons, Flask, web2py, Django, etc...).  Only ~3 lines
of code are required to tie-in ``gevent-socketio`` in your framework.
Note: you need to use the ``gevent`` python WSGI server to use
``gevent-socketio``.


Technical overview
==================

Most of the ``gevent-socketio`` implementation is pure Python.  There
is an obvious dependency on ``gevent``, and another on
``gevent-websocket``.  There are integration examples for Pyramid, Flask,
Django and BYOF (bring your own framework!).
