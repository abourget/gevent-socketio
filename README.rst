Introduction
============

gevent_socketio2 is socketio 1.0 implementation. It is a fork from gevent_socketio, with lots of modification to apply to socketio1.0. It is under heavy development, production usage is not 
recommended.

==================

Depends on 'gevent', 'gevent-websocket', 'pybob', 'pyee'. 

pybob provides a convinient request response class.
pyee is the EventEmitter for python. Since this is a port from socketio, there is lots logic chained by event and listener.
