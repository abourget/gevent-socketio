old gevent socketio

xhr polling:

The loop blocks at socket get_multiple_client_msgs, which call client_queue.get() (it passed a timeout parameter to prevent blocking forever)


websocket:

The handler handle_one_response() waits with gevent.joinall(socket.jobs) 
  * All jobs spawned for the socket is maintained in socket's jobs array. 
    (what about the timeout?)
    A: The transport send_into_ws do a try except, when a WebSocketError raised, (Fllowing is wrong: it will call socket's disconnect() which kills all jobs)
     (Correction: The socket will spawn a watcher, which kills all the jobs and disconnect all namespaces)
     The socket has a kill method, which cleaned all resources, all jobs, disconnect all namespaces etc
    BUG: The disconnect for the socket not set state as closing or closed
